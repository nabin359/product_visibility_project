DELIVERY — CURRENT-STATE BREAKDOWN
(Right-most section of the Product Visibility Diagram)
The Delivery section represents the final operational ownership transfer of a package—from USPS internal custody to customer receipt (or exception). This area is deceptively small visually, but operationally dense and risk-heavy.
1. ENTRY INTO DELIVERY DOMAIN
“Arrival at Delivery Unit (DU)”
What this represents
The package has completed Destination Processing (P&DC or ASF)
Physical custody shifts from plant/network operations to local delivery operations
How it happens operationally
Packages arrive at the Delivery Unit via:
USPS surface transportation (PVS / HCR)
Containerized mail (IMcb)
Mixed with letters/flats in some facilities
Visibility mechanisms shown in the diagram
Container-level scans (IMcb)
Trailer-level scans (99T / 99Z)
Sometimes inferred arrival via transportation events
Key characteristics
Often not a piece-level scan
Frequently calculated or inferred
High dependency on upstream container/trailer data
Immediate visibility risk
Package is physically at the DU but not explicitly visible as “at unit” at the piece level
2. DISTRIBUTION WITHIN DELIVERY UNIT
“Distributed to Route / Carrier Sortation”
What this represents
Packages are sorted internally:
To carrier routes
To cases
To delivery sequence
Operational reality
Largely manual handling
Limited or no mandatory scan
Happens early morning or overnight
Visibility status (per diagram legend)
Typically manual or unidentified
Often not surfaced as an event
Why this matters
This is where a package may be:
Physically present
Actively worked
Yet invisible to enterprise systems
Typical customer symptom
“Your package is arriving late, but tracking hasn’t updated.”
3. OUT FOR DELIVERY (OFD)
“Carrier Departure / Route Start”
What this represents
Package is assigned to a carrier and leaves the unit
How visibility is created
May come from:
Manual carrier scan
Implicit route start logic
Device state changes (MDD / handheld)
Diagram classification
Often shown as:
Manual scan OR
Logical/calculated event
Key constraint
Not guaranteed
OFD may exist logically without an explicit scan
Visibility gap
Many packages jump from “Arrived at Unit” directly to “Delivered” in tracking history
4. IN-TRANSIT TO ADDRESS
“Carrier Enroute”
What this represents
Carrier physically moving toward delivery point
Visibility sources in diagram
GPS breadcrumbing (MDD / scanner)
Route telemetry (passive)
Important distinction
This is not a scan
This is telemetry-based visibility
Enterprise implication
Exists as data
Rarely surfaced cleanly in customer or enterprise reporting
Often underutilized
5. DELIVERY EVENT
“Delivered” (Event Code 01)
What this represents
Final custody transfer to customer or recipient location
Visibility characteristics
Mandatory scan
Piece-level (IMpb)
Highest data reliability in the entire chain
Attributes captured
Timestamp
Geo-location
Delivery type:
Front door
Mailbox
Parcel locker
Left with individual
Business closed, etc.
Diagram status
Fully existing
Mature
Enterprise-reliable
Key reality
Delivery is often the only guaranteed piece-level scan after acceptance
6. DELIVERY EXCEPTIONS
“Attempted / Failed / Alternate Outcomes”
Examples
No access
Business closed
Animal interference
Customer hold
Receptacle full
Visibility
Scan-based
Manual
Event codes vary
Why this matters
Exceptions create:
Delays
Redelivery loops
Customer complaints
Often not tied cleanly back to upstream delays
7. POST-DELIVERY LOGICAL EVENTS
“Logical Delivery / Confirmation / Calculated States”
What the diagram implies
Some delivery states are inferred, not scanned
Examples:
“Delivered to building”
“Delivered to agent”
Batch confirmations
Visibility classification
Logical / calculated
Dependent on rule engines, not physical scans
DELIVERY VISIBILITY — WHAT THE DIAGRAM IS REALLY TELLING YOU
If you strip away the graphics, the delivery section communicates four critical truths:
1. Delivery visibility is scan-rich at the end, but scan-poor before it
Strong signal at “Delivered”
Weak signal between:
Arrival at unit
Out for delivery
2. Human behavior dominates this domain
Manual scans
Manual sortation
Manual exception handling
3. GPS/telemetry exists but is under-leveraged
Passive data present
Not consistently translated into enterprise-grade events
4. Most “where is my package?” problems originate here
Not because delivery failed
But because visibility failed before delivery occurred
HOW THIS SHOULD SHAPE YOUR TIGER TEAM START
If you are starting from the delivery side, your first concrete actions should be:
Define the minimum delivery-side event set
Arrived at Unit (piece-level or reliable inference)
Out for Delivery
Delivered / Exception
Inventory which of these are:
Mandatory
Optional
Calculated
Missing from DataBricks
Measure gaps
% of packages with Delivered but no OFD
% with Delivered but no Arrived at Unit
Average DU dwell time (arrival → delivery)
Treat Delivery as your anchor
Work backwards from Delivered
Every upstream gap is exposed here

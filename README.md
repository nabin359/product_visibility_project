Tiger Team Project Kickoff: End‑to‑End Product Management Remapping
Team
Leads: Ernie and Travis

Cross‑functional collaboration with DataBricks and enterprise visibility teams

Objective
Remap the end‑to‑end package management process — from acceptance through delivery — to identify gaps in scan data, improve visibility, and establish a foundation for enterprise‑level reporting and analysis.

Scope
Start point: Package acceptance (e.g., BMEU, Manifest, MHTS)

End point: Delivery at destination address

Focus: All intermediate scan events (codes such as 01 for delivery, 17 series for transit scans)

Scale: 6.3 billion packages annually, ~20 million per night across 380 plants

Challenges
Incomplete or inconsistent scan data between acceptance and delivery

Heavy reliance on human scanning introduces variability and gaps

Some data not surfaced in DataBricks, limiting enterprise visibility

Complex, evolving network with many moving parts

Deliverables
Process Map: Visualize the full package journey step by step (using Vizio or similar tools)

Gap Analysis: Identify missing scans or data points across the flow

Dashboard: Build a reporting layer for near real‑time visibility and analysis

Enterprise Asset Alignment: Ensure mapping ties into other teams and systems (e.g., DataBricks)

Leadership Presentation: Show acceptance, delivery, and intermediate steps with clear visibility gaps

Next Steps
Begin with the carrier handoff and acceptance process

Document “what happens next” at each stage of the package journey

Validate scan codes and events against operational data

Create a visibility map highlighting the “big piece in the middle” where focus is needed

Establish foundation for future initiatives leveraging this mapping
